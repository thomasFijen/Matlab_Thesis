This folder contains the Matlab scripts to evolve the NNs using NEAT.
------------------------------

The File is: Run_neatSimulation_D.m, this calls all the other files necessry for evolution. 
Here you can:
	Specify the dimensions of the MS (The 'grid_MS' strucutre)
	Choose to Evolve a NN or test an existing one (the 'test' parameter)
	Define simulation parameters ('sim' strucutre). NOTE: the inputs into the NN are controlled by sim.inFormat parameter.
		-  sim.inFormat = 2 (Pure duarate, case 1 for report)
		-  sim.inFormat = 4 (Input case 2 from report)
		-  sim.inFormat = 6 (Input case 4 from report)
		-  sim.inFormat = 7 (Input case 5 from report)
		-  sim.inFormat = 8 (Input case 3 from report)
		- see the nn_inputs script for more details
	Assign MAV properties like max speed, sensor range, refuelling parameters etc.
	Define the maximum population size for the NEAT evolution

The other files are as follows:
For the simulated environment:
	ageMS_D - Updates the (global) age map at each time step	
	agentDynamics_D - This defines the dynamics of the MAVs used
	antennae_D - Implements the 'feelers'. Returns both cell ages and ranges
	antennaeCell_D - Implements the 'feelers'. Returns only the cell age
	antennaeCellAve_D - Implements the 'feelers'. Returns average cell ages along the feeler
	calcTotalAge_D - sum of all individual cell ages (excluding obstacles)
	geofence - This calulate the inputs for Duartes geofence sensors
	getMS_arrayIndex_D - returns the x and y indeces of the current cell the MAV is in
	initEnviron_D - initialises a (fixed) MS with no obstacles. This will not vary randomly 
	initEnviron_Rand - initialises a random MS with obstacles. This will vary randomly in size and shape
	interDroneRange - Calculates values of the robot sensor from Duarte
	liverpool_Inputs - calulates the inputs for replicating the experiment from Liverpool (Input case 5 from my report)
	visited_D - determines which cells were visited  in the current time step and update their age.
	weightedAveMS_D - calculates the input values for Input Case 4

NN Code:
	calcNN_edit - calculates the outputs for each of the nodes in the NN
	formatNN_edit - This is an improvement over the original NEAT code. This determines the structure of the NN allowing the calculation of the outputs to be more efficient.
	initial_population - Original NEAT Code. Creates the initial NN for evolution
	performNeatRun - Original NEAT code. This handels the evolution, and all NEAT parameters are defined here. Whether you want a random or a fixed MS is also defined here.
	rep - Original NEAT code from http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~kstanley/neat.html.
	reproduce - Original NEAT code from http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~kstanley/neat.html.
	simulatedRun_D - Performs the (single) simulation for the current population and calculates the Fitness value. NOTE: the fitness function used is defined here.
	simulatedRun_Extended - Performs multiple simulations for the current population and calculates the Fitness value. NOTE: the fitness function used is defined here.

For Refuelling:
	avoidance - implements the additional avoidance measures
	behaviourTree - Implements the BT. NOTE: threshold values are adjusted here
	fuel - Updates the current fuel level of the MAV at each time step
	homing - Travel towards the Depot

Misc.
	controllerComparison.m was used to compare the perofmance of the NNs created from the different input types
	testInput6.m was used for the post evaluation of the chosen input type
