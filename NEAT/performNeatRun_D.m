    % upshot of this is: the settings above will start with initial population (of your specification) and save all important structures at every generation, so if your workstation crashes or you have to interrupt evolution, you can, at next startup, simply set the load flag to 1 and continue where you have left off. 
    % Please note, however, that only changing structures are saved, the parameters in this section will not be saved, so you have to ensure that you use the same parameters when using a saved version of evolution as when you created this saved version!
